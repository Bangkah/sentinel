# Sentinel AI CLI

Sentinel AI CLI is a professional, open-source cybersecurity CLI tool for Linux systems. It provides real-time network monitoring, system information, intelligent connection analysis, and risk classification to help you secure your machine.

---



## Features

- **Network Scanner**: List all active network connections with process details
- **System Information**: Display OS, kernel, CPU, memory, and hostname
- **Connection Analyzer**: Detect and classify suspicious connections with numeric risk scoring (0–100) and risk level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- **Report Command**: Show summary of total connections, external connections, risk counts, and overall system risk score
- **Explain Command**: Explain if an IP/connection is potentially dangerous
- **Debug**: Run and debug a Python file, catching exceptions and logging errors
- **Explain Code**: Summarize and list functions/classes in a Python file
- **Improve Code**: Auto-format a Python file using autopep8 for better readability
- **Colored Output**: Professional, readable CLI with colorama
- **Logging**: All actions and errors are logged for auditing
- **Production-Ready**: Modular, clean, and robust code

## Installation

1. Install from PyPI:
  ```bash
  pip install sentinel-ai-cli
  ```
2. Or clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Bangkah/sentinel.git
  cd sentinel
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Run Sentinel AI CLI:
  ```bash
  sentinel-ai --help
  ```

## Usage Examples

- **Scan active network connections:**
  ```bash
  sentinel-ai scan
  ```
- **Show system information:**
  ```bash
  sentinel-ai system
  ```
- **Analyze connections and classify risk (with numeric score):**
  ```bash
  sentinel-ai analyze
  ```
  Output example:
  ```
  Proto  Local Address         Remote Address        PID     Process              Risk            Reason
  TCP    192.168.1.10:54321   8.8.8.8:53            1234    python3              HIGH (87/100)   External IP connection; Unusual port 53; Unknown process: python3
  ...
  ```
- **Show summary report:**
  ```bash
  sentinel-ai report
  ```
  Output example:
  ```
  === Sentinel AI CLI Security Report ===
  Total connections: 12
  External connections: 3
  High risk: 1
  Medium risk: 2
  Low risk: 9
  Overall system risk: HIGH (72/100)
  ```
- **Explain a specific IP address:**
  ```bash
  python3 sentinel_ai.py explain 8.8.8.8
  ```
- **Debug a Python file:**
  ```bash
  python3 sentinel_ai.py debug path/to/your_script.py
  ```
- **Explain a Python code file:**
  ```bash
  python3 sentinel_ai.py explain-code path/to/your_script.py
  ```
- **Improve (auto-format) a Python code file:**
  ```bash
  python3 sentinel_ai.py improve-code path/to/your_script.py
  ```

## How GitHub Copilot CLI Helped

GitHub Copilot CLI accelerated the development of Sentinel AI by:
- Generating modular, production-ready Python code
- Suggesting robust error handling and logging patterns
- Providing intelligent CLI argument parsing with argparse
- Recommending best practices for security and code structure
- Speeding up the implementation of colored output and risk analysis logic

Thanks to Copilot CLI, Sentinel AI was built faster, with higher code quality and maintainability.
